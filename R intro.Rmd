```{r}
1 + 100
10*10
10*945/3
(1+1)/(5*7)
```
Now lets' try something more complicated

```{r}
sin(1)
```
```{r}
log(1)

```
Create some variables



```{r}
x <- sin(1)
x
x * 10
x == 0.841471
x = 10
x == 5
x == 10
x <- sin(1)
x == sin(1)
x == 10

```
Vectors

```{r}
myVector <- 1:10
myVector

myVector*2

```

Installing packages

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

compare mass to age
```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20

mass > age
mass == age

```

The mass was larger than age

```{r}

```
